    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project was fun but challenging. I had to put together all of the skills that I’ve learned thus far to make this website. I think I did very well with the HTML portions while the CSS portion took me more time. I also struggled with managing my time on this project. If I were to do this again I would definitely have started it a lot sooner and spent a little time a day on it rather than a lot of time in a few days. The feedback I received was to add a footer and body paragraph sections. The footer was part of the design requirements I hadn’t done yet, and the body paragraph section helped clean up the title header of each page.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancment</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement allows for users running on modern browsers to use exclusive features and best possible experience for a website. While also providing a baseline of just the essential content to all the other users.</p>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is important in modern web development because its accessibility is universal. It ensures that the website can run efficiently on any device/browser so your audience is widened. Today almost everyone has access to the internet. With progressive enhancement, everyone with access to the internet will be able to have at least an informative well laid out website experience while also leaving room for the nicer features for users with better internet.</p>
